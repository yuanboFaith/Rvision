This webpage summarizes some of the common techniques I used in data visualization in R with ggplot2. More R tips and advanced techniques illustrated with inspiring graphics can be found in the [ggplot2 Graphic Gallery](https://www.databrewer.co/R/gallery) @ [DataBrewer](https://www.databrewer.co/). In addition, a complete tutorial on [data wrangling](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling), the very critical foundation behind all stunning data visuals, can be found in the following resources:

  - [tidyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tidyr/introduction): transform (e.g., pivoting) the dataset into tidy structure.
  - [dplyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/dplyr/0-introduction): a basic tool to work with data frames.     
  - [stringr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/stringr/0-introduction): work with strings. 
  - [regular expression](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/regular-expression/0-introduction): search and match a string pattern.
  - [purrr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/purrr/introduction): functional programming (e.g., iterating functions across elements of columns).
  - [tibble](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tibble/introduction): work with data frames in the modern tibble structure.
